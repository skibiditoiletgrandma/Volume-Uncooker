# Volume-Uncooker
A tool made for uncooking volumes in the editor. This was made for modding fnaf9 in Unreal Engine 4.27.2.

How It Works As Simply As Possible: 
It copies data from volumes that were selected by the user, and then makes brand new volumes and imports the data correctly and automatically.

Supported:
✅Akreverb Volumes

✅Level Streaming Volumes (as long as the levels in the volume's array elements are loaded, it will automatically add it to the level details tab)

✅Lightmass Importance Volumes

✅Blocking Volumes

✅Nav Mesh Volumes

✅Nav Modifiers Volumes

✅Pre-computed Visibility Volumes
